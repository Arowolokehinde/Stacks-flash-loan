# Stacks Flash Loans

This repository contains a project that demonstrates the implementation of flash loans using the Stacks blockchain. Flash loans are uncollateralized loans that must be borrowed and repaid within the same transaction. This project is designed to showcase how such functionality can be implemented using Clarity, the smart contract language for Stacks.

## Overview

Flash loans are a powerful tool in decentralized finance (DeFi). They allow users to borrow assets without collateral, provided the loan is repaid within the same transaction. This project demonstrates how to implement flash loans on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts.

## Features

- Implementation of flash loans in Clarity.
- Example use cases for flash loans.
- Unit tests to ensure contract functionality.
- Documentation for understanding and extending the project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later)
- [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) (for testing and development)
- [Stacks CLI](https://github.com/stacksjs/cli) (optional, for interacting with the Stacks blockchain)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/stacks-flash-loans.git
    cd stacks-flash-loans
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up your development environment (if required).

## Usage

1. Compile the Clarity contracts:

    ```bash
    clarinet check
    ```

2. Run the tests:

    ```bash
    npm run test
    ```


3. Interact with the contracts using the Stacks CLI or a frontend application.
